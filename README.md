# Anonymous Secrets
This is my last project in General Assembly.

This app was built to let people share their secrets anonymously. People can see other people's secrets and add comments.

## Built with
- React
- Ruby on Rails
- Python (Web Scraping, Semantic Analysis)

## Heroku Demo
Disclaimer: The contents of the website, which contains more than 5,000 secrets and 20,000 comments, were generated by web scraping from other similar websites. You may find many of them to be offensive, including vulgar, obscene, racial, etc.

VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

Live demo [here](https://secret-share-client.herokuapp.com).

## TODO
Use Python and Gensim (a human language processing library) to analyse the text of each secret, and add recommendations of similar stories.
